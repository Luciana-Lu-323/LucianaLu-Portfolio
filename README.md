# ✨ Luciana Lu — Coding with Empathy

Hi! I’m **Luna Lu**, a U.S.–Taiwan student passionate about using science, coding, and empathy to make life better for others.  
I believe **technology should have a heart** — every project I build comes from curiosity and care.

## 💡 Social Impact Projects

### [Unbroken Voices – Anti-Bullying Campaign](#)
After experiencing bullying in junior high, I decided to turn pain into strength.  
I created **Unbroken Voices**, an Instagram project where students share their stories through short videos.  
Now I’m expanding it into **on-camera interviews**, using a microphone and storytelling to spread empathy and awareness.

## 🌱 Reflection Essays

### *Why I Started Coding for Others*  
Coding isn’t just about solving problems — it’s about noticing where people hurt, and creating tools to help.

### *Taiwan’s Garbage Truck Culture*  
I’m fascinated by how Taiwanese people come together at night to take out trash — chatting, laughing, helping each other.  
I want to show the world how small acts of responsibility can be a form of love for the planet.
