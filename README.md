# 🌍 Luna Lu — Coding with Empathy

Hi! I’m **Luna Lu**, a U.S.–Taiwan student passionate about using science, coding, and empathy to make life better for others.  
I believe **technology should have a heart** — every project I build comes from curiosity and care.

## 🧬 STEM Projects

### 1. [COVID-19 Icosahedron Model](#)
When I was in elementary school, I saw the image of the coronavirus on TV and wondered:  
“Why is it shaped like a sphere?”  
That curiosity led me to discover the **icosahedron**, the geometric shape closest to a sphere.  
I built my own 3D model and presented it at the **National Teaching Aids Exhibition**, winning the *National Merit Award* as the youngest participant.

### 2. [Python x Disaster Relief Volunteer Map](#)
After seeing the landslide disaster in Hualien, I imagined how coding could connect volunteers and people in need.  
I built a simple **web map** using *Python + Leaflet + JSON*, showing:
- 🔴 Areas that need help  
- 🟢 Volunteer stations  

> Purpose: To make information travel faster than disaster.

### 3. [Arduino / Robotics Lab Project](#)
In school’s robotics class, I designed a prototype that detects when trash bins are full and alerts the cleaning staff with a light signal.  
Our department head said I learned “unusually fast” and kept experimenting beyond the syllabus.

## 💡 Social Impact Projects

### [Unbroken Voices – Anti-Bullying Campaign](#)
After experiencing bullying in junior high, I decided to turn pain into strength.  
I created **Unbroken Voices**, an Instagram project where students share their stories through short videos.  
Now I’m expanding it into **on-camera interviews**, using a microphone and storytelling to spread empathy and awareness.

## 🌱 Reflection Essays

### *Why I Started Coding for Others*  
Coding isn’t just about solving problems — it’s about noticing where people hurt, and creating tools to help.

### *Taiwan’s Garbage Truck Culture*  
I’m fascinated by how Taiwanese people come together at night to take out trash — chatting, laughing, helping each other.  
I want to show the world how small acts of responsibility can be a form of love for the planet.
