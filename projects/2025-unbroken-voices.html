      I started this anti-bullying Instagram because my mom and I truly tried everything.
      I applied for a school investigation, gathered evidence, and wrote letters to the Education Director, the Mayor, and even the President, hoping someone would help. My mom even sought help from a highly accomplished legal team, as well as city councilors and legislators, but we realized that even then, the system couldn’t truly protect students.
      The doctor said I didn’t need medication, my counselor said I was mature, and my teacher said the problem wasn’t me—but nothing changed.
      The one who truly caught me when I was falling was my psychiatrist, Dr. Chung Yi-Hang — he was a light in the dark.
      In the end, I withdrew the investigation, knowing that path had reached its limit.
      So I chose another way to make change.
      After experiencing bullying, I started Unbroken Voices in 2025 to amplify students’ stories and provide practical resources for wellbeing and action.
      The project includes interviews, short-form videos, and a resource kit co-designed with school counselors and peers.
      I created this Instagram not to blame anyone, but to show that even when children, parents, and teachers try their best, we still need a better system—one that allows every child to learn in safety, respect, and joy.
      Education is the foundation of a nation.
