# 🧬 COVID-19 Icosahedron Model

### Inspiration
During elementary school, I often saw the 3D images of the COVID-19 virus on TV.  
I wondered: *“Why is the virus almost spherical?”*  

This curiosity led me to discover the **icosahedron**, the geometric solid that most closely resembles a sphere.

### Process
- Designed and built the structure using paper modules and geometric calculations.  
- Learned how symmetry and polygons form natural stability in biological structures.  
- Presented at the **National Teaching Aids Exhibition**, winning the *National Merit Award*.

### Reflection
> “Science starts from curiosity — when we ask ‘why’, we start building our own universe of answers.”
