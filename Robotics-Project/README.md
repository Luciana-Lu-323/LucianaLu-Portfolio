# 🤖 Arduino / Robotics Lab Project

### Idea
In my school’s robotics class, I noticed that cleaning staff often didn’t know when trash bins were full.  
So I designed a **smart sensor system** that detects when the bin is full and lights up an alert.

### Implementation
- Used **Arduino + Ultrasonic Sensor** to detect distance from the lid.  
- Programmed logic in C++ to trigger LED and buzzer when threshold exceeded.  
- Presented to the school’s STEM director, who said I “learn unusually fast.”

### Learning Outcome
- Learned how to combine **mechanical design, coding, and empathy** in one project.  
- Realized that small inventions can make daily life easier for others.

### Reflection
> “Robotics is not about machines — it’s about helping humans work with less pain and more dignity.”
